# hi, i am

**Eunki Joung**. I am a master's student in the field of HCI (Human-Computer Interaction). 

I am currently studying with Prof. Uichin Lee at the [Interactive Computing Lab](https://ic.kaist.ac.kr), KAIST.

As a researcher, I am interested in the following broad questions:
- Whose voices are invisible?
- How can we bring those invisible voices to public spheres[^public-spheres]?
- What should those public spheres look like?

[^public-spheres]: Some people may realize JÃ¼rgen Habermas's theory, when I say 'public spheres'. I think that can be a good start to share my hope of genuine and inclusive communication, but I am not an expert of his theory yet. Thus, please do not think it as a rigor use of 'public sphere,' if you are knowledgable to that concept. Also, I intentionally used a plural form of 'public spheres' because I think there can be multiple forms of public spheres working well at particular contexts, which I hope to explore.

(Do not panic ðŸ¤–! I know these are very broad questions, and connecting them with HCI and my experiences need more works. I will be gradually more specific by following paragraphs. Stay tuned!)

At the same time, I have experiences with and fondness for the following objects:
- **Programming languages** and the **artifacts** realized by them. 
  - I love Cumpa, a caring companion for mindful self-exploration, that I built with my colleagues. 
  - (What is Cumpa? That will be something I will write another post about.)
  - As a magic wand that can make my imagination real, and as a lego blocks that can be arranged in a perfect order, programming languages have been my favorite toys since I was a child. (You may find my fondness for the art of programming in this blog posts.)
  - But at the same time, I am oppoesed to the idea that the programming languages, or moreover the computer science, are solely the magic wand that will solve all the problems without harms. (You may also find my thoughts on this in various places in this blog.)
  - Stay tuned! I will gradually update the projects I have been working on ðŸª¼.
  
- **Writing,** especially those representing the everyday lives of people. 
  - I love both my own writings and those of others! 
  - Good writing! That is one of the key goals of my life journey, though my thoughts on 'what is good writing' will be always changing.
  - Before my own writings, let's talk about the writings of others. This is my (partial) list of favorite writing genres.
    - **Ethnographies and Documentaries:** Yes, actually this is very broad category. But I intentially left it broad to focus on their common questions: "What is the everyday lives of people like?" "What are the meaning of their everyday lives?" Addressing these questions, the pieces in this category acknowledge the 'meanings' are subjectively constructed by individuals, cultures, and structures, and thus put lots of effort to visit, observe, and represent the sites.
      - One of my favorite text is "[Poverty as Process: The arrangement of poverty and the anthropology of the vernerable lives](https://product.kyobobook.co.kr/detail/S000200204406)" by Prof. Mun Young Jo (Unfortunately, only Korean version is available. Translation of the title is mine, so it may not be accurate). 
      - Also, I love the book "[The Social Life of Small Urban Spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Social_Life_of_Small_Urban_Spaces)." I first met this book in the social computing class led by Prof. Juho Kim, and it was the first time I realized that ethnographic studies and design in the HCI field may be my future path. 
    - **Theories:** Again, very broad category. In my use, these are the texts that interpret the world (represented by a lot of available materials) through a particular lens. If this kind of work does not involve the fieldwork, I call it a 'theory.'
      - Please see [Human, Place, Hospitality](https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=TQ6vDQAAQBAJ)! Maybe 10 times (again, I am sorry only Korean version is available). The main question of this book is: "When we be human?" "Were we human since we were born? What kind of 'hospitality' let us be a member of society, and thus a human?" It covers various sites and identities (e.g., women, soldiers, disabled people) where they are excluded from, or conditionally included to the society, and thus the position of 'human' is not guaranteed. I read this book when I was a college student, and its insightful theoretical viewpoints have been motivating me to study (not just advocate) inclusion of marginzalized, not 'normal' people. 
      - 'Normal,' with the quotation marks? The former book had led me to be interested in Erving Goffman, a 20C sociologist who left a lot of insights on the construction of the 'normal' and the experiences and strategies of people who are not 'normal,' such as people with [stigma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigma:_Notes_on_the_Management_of_Spoiled_Identity), people in [asylums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylums_(book)), or people who fell into temporary 'abnormal' situations (See [The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Presentation_of_Self_in_Everyday_Life) or [Interaction Ritual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_Ritual:_Essays_on_Face-to-Face_Behavior)). Among these, my favorite is Stigma (1963), which describes how the stigmatized people manage their visible cues of identity like a game, revealing and concealing them in a strategic way. 
        - Also, Goffman investigated a lot about 'symbolic' interactions, such as greeting. If you want, you can give a warm greet to me here: The [Guest Book](https://eunkiyomi.github.io/2023/10/26/symbolic-interactions.html).
